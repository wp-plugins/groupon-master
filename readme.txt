== Description ==

One of our main concerns at TechGasp is to find solid ways for wordpress based websites to generate revenue. For that we already launched professional plugins like Google Ads Master or Amazon Master.

Now it's time to tap into big bucks with the famous and acclaimed Groupon network. Groupon is a website that features deals-of-the-day in major cities with excellent prices.

Groupon Master lets you integrate Groupon Deals inside your wordpress blog. It was never this easy to share and sell those deals with your users and visitors. Groupon Master automatically displays this ads and generates lot's of cash.

The plugin is totally customizable within the Groupon API, that means it fits perfectly into any of your template widget positions. With more than 15 ad sizes and side deals, it also packs groupon api accent color for the ads.

That's not all, you can even specify a city to show ads from or just have the cities in auto-detect according to the origin of your wordpress visitor.

Main features: Solid Revenue for Wordpress - Uses Groupon API (select any of the major cities supported by Groupon to show ads from or have it in Auto-Detect visitor city) - API ad sizes - API city selector - API deals - Minimal code, fast load times, error free, no conflicts - Google SEO Ready - Shortcode framework v2 to publish ads inside pages and posts - Easy to use, documentation available
